### CPSC 120

* Lab 3, part 1
I liked this lab because I felt it was the first time we were coding. It was the first time we were challenged. We were able to put together what we had learned in the previous labs to work through a code that would figure out how much a pizza cost per square inch.

* Lab 3, part 2
I enjoyed this lab because it helped us learn and implement the use of functions and how to write them. This was a very important lab to reference for future labs. I also liked the concept of this lab of figuring out the number of days between two given days.

* Lab 6 part 2
In this lab we created a code to compute the score of the two cards then output the total of the two. This was one of my favorite labs because we also got to learn how the game of blackjack works and how a game like this could transfer well in code.
